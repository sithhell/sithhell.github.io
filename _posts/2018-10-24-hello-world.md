This marks the beginning of my own personal blog!

During the last period of finishing my dissertation, I was getting tired of
writing papers and lots and lots of walls of text. However, it is still
important to spread out the word and the results of my research. For this,
I am planning to release series of small posts on this space, without having
to write full blown scientific papers. Nevertheless, I am still aming for high
quality, properly researched articles. Just in smaller pieces :-)
