This is a personal blog about topics surrounding HPX and
asynchronous programming based on futures. The futures value is to
be determined...

My name is Thomas Heller and I am a researcher in the field of Parallel Programming.
My main research interest is in how to efficiently programming runtime systems for
any scale computing systems. Ranging from small embedded devices to large scale
supercomputers. This interest is bundled into the devolpement of the [HPX][HPX]
runtime system.

I currently work part time, as a lecturer at the Friedrich-Alexander-University Erlangen-Nuremberg,
and the rest of time is dedicated around topics concering HPX as a (founding) member of the [STE||AR-Group][stellar].

If you want to support my effort and want me spending more time on HPX and related topics, write me an email!

Currently involved projects:
 - Phylanx

Past Projects:
 - AllScale
